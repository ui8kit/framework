# Engine DSL Enforcement

Scope: this rule is mandatory for any edits under `apps/engine/**`.

## Non-negotiable constraints

1. Do not hardcode business/content values in engine components. Move values to props, data sources, or template variables.
2. Build template logic strictly with `@ui8kit/template` DSL primitives (`If`, `Else`, `ElseIf`, `Loop`, `Var`, `Slot`, `Include`, `DefineBlock`, `Extends`) when logic/output targets template generation.
3. Follow ui8kit semantics: use semantic components and props, avoid `className`, inline `style`, raw HTML wrappers when ui8kit primitives exist.
4. Keep all comments and docs in English.

## Required checks before finalizing

1. Run lint for the engine scope using the lint package:
   - `bun --filter @ui8kit/lint run lint`
   - or workspace equivalent that executes `packages/lint` validation.
2. If a command cannot be run, explicitly report it and why; do not claim success.

## Reject patterns

- Hardcoded literals that should be template/data variables (titles, labels, prices, statuses, feature flags).
- Direct template syntax strings instead of DSL components when editing React/TSX sources.
- Any change that bypasses `packages/lint` validation without reporting the skipped check.
