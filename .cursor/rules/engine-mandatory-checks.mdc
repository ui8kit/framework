# Engine Mandatory Checks

For any change inside `apps/engine/**`, complete this checklist before final answer.

1. Run engine lint:
   - `bun run lint` (from `apps/engine`)
2. Run engine DSL lint:
   - `bun run lint:dsl` (from `apps/engine`)
3. If generation flow is involved, re-generate and sync:
   - `bun run generate` (from `apps/engine`)
   - `bun run scripts/copy-templates-to-dev.ts` (from repo root)
4. Report command outcomes honestly (pass/fail and reason if skipped).

If any required check is skipped, explicitly state why and what remains unverified.
